# Property-Prices-EDA

🏡 Property Prices Analysis - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
📌 Project Overview
This project aims to analyze property prices across different locations and factors affecting real estate value. Using Python, we explore trends, correlations, and insights that can help businesses and investors make data-driven decisions.

📊 Objectives:

Understand the key factors influencing property prices.

Analyze the impact of location, facilities, and finance on pricing.

Identify trends that can help in real estate decision-making.

🛠 Tech Stack & Libraries Used
Python

Pandas

NumPy

Matplotlib & Seaborn (for visualizations)

Scikit-learn (if applicable)

Dataset Overview:
The dataset contains property-related information, including details about location, size, amenities, pricing, and ownership. It is structured into two main sections.

The first section includes Property ID, Location, Region, Size (sq ft), Number of Bedrooms, Number of Bathrooms, Year Built, Has Garage, Has Garden, Has Swimming Pool, and Nearby Schools. These features describe the physical attributes and facilities available in each property.

The second section provides additional details such as Nearby Hospitals, Nearby Shopping Malls, Price ($), Last Renovation Year, Property Type, Owner Name, and Owner Contact. This part helps in understanding the financial aspects, accessibility to amenities, and ownership details.

The dataset can be used to analyze the impact of property size, location, and facilities on price, trends in renovation and construction, and the relationship between nearby amenities and property value.


🎯 Future Scope
Implementing predictive modeling for price forecasting.

Expanding the dataset with additional features like crime rate and demographics.

Building a dashboard for interactive data exploration.
